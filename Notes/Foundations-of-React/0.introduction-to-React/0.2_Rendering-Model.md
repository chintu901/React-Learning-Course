# Rendering Model

## Single Page Applications (SPA)

A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content without reloading the entire page.

Instead of requesting a new HTML page from the server for every interaction, an SPA updates only the necessary parts of the interface using JavaScript.

In traditional websites, clicking a link typically:
- Sends a request to the server
- Reloads the entire page
- Re-renders everything

In an SPA:
- The page loads once
- JavaScript handles navigation
- Only specific components update

React is commonly used to build SPAs because it efficiently manages UI updates.

### Single Page Application (Modern Model)
- Loads one main HTML file
- JavaScript dynamically updates content
- Navigation handled client-side

**Advantages:**
- Faster user experience
- Smooth transitions
- Better for highly interactive apps

**Disadvantages:**
- Initial load can be heavy
- SEO requires additional configuration
- Requires client-side routing

## Traditional DOM vs Virtual DOM

To understand React’s performance model, you must understand the difference between the **DOM** and the **Virtual DOM**.

### DOM

The DOM (**Document Object Model**) is a tree-like representation of HTML elements in the browser.

Example HTML:
``` html
<div>
  <h1>Hello</h1>
</div>
```

The browser converts this into a DOM tree structure.

JavaScript can modify this DOM directly:
``` javascript
document.querySelector("h1").textContent = "Hi";
```

**Problems with Direct DOM Manipulation**

Direct DOM updates are:
- Relatively slow
- Expensive in large applications
- Difficult to manage manually
- Prone to UI inconsistencies

Because:
- Every DOM change can trigger reflow and repaint.
- Large trees make updates costly.
- Developers must track changes manually.
- As applications grow, managing DOM changes becomes complex.

### Virtual DOM

The **Virtual DOM** is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM.

Instead of directly modifying the browser DOM, React:
- Creates a Virtual DOM copy.
- Updates the Virtual DOM when state changes.
- Compares (diffs) the new version with the previous one.
- Updates only the changed parts in the real DOM.

This process is called reconciliation.

**How Virtual DOM Improves Performance**

Instead of this:
- Rebuilding the entire UI
- Updating large DOM trees unnecessarily

React does this:
- Calculates minimal changes
- Applies only necessary updates
- Avoids excessive DOM operations

This makes UI updates more efficient and predictable.
