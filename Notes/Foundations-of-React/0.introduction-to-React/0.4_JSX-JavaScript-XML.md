# JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is one of the most recognizable features of React. It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript. While it may look like HTML, JSX is not HTML. It is a syntax extension that gets transformed into regular JavaScript before running in the browser.

Understanding JSX is essential because almost every React component returns JSX.

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows you to describe the UI structure in a way that looks similar to HTML but works inside JavaScript files.

Example:
``` python
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World</h1>;
}
```
Although this looks like HTML, it is actually JavaScript. Behind the scenes, JSX is converted into function calls.

For example, the above code is transformed (by tools like Babel) into:
``` python
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World");
```
This means JSX is simply a more readable way to write `React.createElement()` calls.

## Rules of JSX

### 1️⃣ Return a single root element

To return **multiple elements** from a component, wrap them with a **single parent tag**.

For example, you can use a `<div>`:

``` js
function Header(){
    return (
        <div>
            // HTML code here
        </div>
    )
}
```

If you don’t want to add an extra `<div>` to your markup, you can write `<>` and `</>` instead:

``` js
function Name() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
            <img 
                src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
                alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
                class="photo"
            >
            <ul>
                ...
            </ul>
        </>
    )
}
```

This empty tag is called a `Fragment`. `Fragments` let you **group things** without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.


### 2️⃣ Close all the tags 

JSX requires tags to be **explicitly closed**: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become written as `<img />`, and wrapping tags like `<li>`oranges must be written as `<li>`oranges`</li>`.

This is how image and list items look closed:

``` html
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### 3️⃣ camelCase all most of the things! 

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like `class`.

This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of `stroke-width` you use `strokeWidth`. Since `class` is a reserved word, in React you write `className` instead, named after the corresponding DOM property:

``` html
<img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
  alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
  className="photo"
/>
```
