# JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is one of the most recognizable features of React. It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript. While it may look like HTML, JSX is not HTML. It is a syntax extension that gets transformed into regular JavaScript before running in the browser.

Understanding JSX is essential because almost every React component returns JSX.

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows you to describe the UI structure in a way that looks similar to HTML but works inside JavaScript files.

Example:
``` python
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World</h1>;
}
```
Although this looks like HTML, it is actually JavaScript. Behind the scenes, JSX is converted into function calls.

For example, the above code is transformed (by tools like Babel) into:
``` python
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World");
```
This means JSX is simply a more readable way to write `React.createElement()` calls.

## Rules of JSX

### 1️⃣ Return a single root element

To return **multiple elements** from a component, wrap them with a **single parent tag**.

For example, you can use a `<div>`:

``` js
function Header(){
    return (
        <div>
            // HTML code here
        </div>
    )
}
```

If you don’t want to add an extra `<div>` to your markup, you can write `<>` and `</>` instead:

``` js
function Name() {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hedy Lamarr's Todos</h1>
            <img 
                src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
                alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
                class="photo"
            >
            <ul>
                ...
            </ul>
        </>
    )
}
```

This empty tag is called a `Fragment`. `Fragments` let you **group things** without leaving any trace in the browser HTML tree.


### 2️⃣ Close all the tags 

JSX requires tags to be **explicitly closed**: self-closing tags like `<img>` must become written as `<img />`, and wrapping tags like `<li>`oranges must be written as `<li>`oranges`</li>`.

This is how image and list items look closed:

``` html
<>
  <img 
    src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
    alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
    class="photo"
   />
  <ul>
    <li>Invent new traffic lights</li>
    <li>Rehearse a movie scene</li>
    <li>Improve the spectrum technology</li>
  </ul>
</>
```

### 3️⃣ camelCase all most of the things! 

JSX turns into JavaScript and attributes written in JSX become keys of JavaScript objects. In your own components, you will often want to read those attributes into variables. But JavaScript has limitations on variable names. For example, their names can’t contain dashes or be reserved words like `class`.

This is why, in React, many HTML and SVG attributes are written in camelCase. For example, instead of `stroke-width` you use `strokeWidth`. Since `class` is a reserved word, in React you write `className` instead, named after the corresponding DOM property:

``` html
<img 
  src="https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg" 
  alt="Hedy Lamarr" 
  className="photo"
/>
```

## JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.

### Passing strings with quotes 

When you want to pass a string attribute to JSX, you put it in single or double quotes:

``` js
export default function Avatar() {
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src="https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"
      alt="Gregorio Y. Zara"
    />
  );
}

```

Here, `"https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg"` and `"Gregorio Y. Zara"` are being passed as strings.

But what if you want to dynamically specify the `src` or `alt` text? You could use a value from JavaScript by replacing `"` and `"` with `{` and `}`:

``` js
export default function Avatar() {
  const avatar = 'https://i.imgur.com/7vQD0fPs.jpg';
  const description = 'Gregorio Y. Zara';
  return (
    <img
      className="avatar"
      src={avatar}
      alt={description}
    />
  );
}
```

Notice the difference between `className="avatar"`, which specifies an `"avatar"` CSS class name that makes the image round, and `src={avatar}` that reads the value of the JavaScript variable called `avatar`. That’s because curly braces let you work with JavaScript right there in your markup!

### Using “double curlies”: CSS and other objects in JSX 

In addition to strings, numbers, and other JavaScript expressions, you can even pass objects in JSX. Objects are also denoted with curly braces, like `{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }`. Therefore, to pass a JS object in JSX, you must wrap the object in another pair of curly braces: `person={{ name: "Hedy Lamarr", inventions: 5 }}`.

You may see this with inline CSS styles in JSX. React does not require you to use inline styles (CSS classes work great for most cases). But when you need an inline style, you pass an object to the style attribute:

``` js
export default function TodoList() {
  return (
    <ul style={{
      backgroundColor: 'black',
      color: 'pink'
    }}>
      <li>Improve the videophone</li>
      <li>Prepare aeronautics lectures</li>
      <li>Work on the alcohol-fuelled engine</li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```
The next time you see `{{` and `}}` in JSX, know that it’s nothing more than an object inside the JSX curlies!
