# JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is one of the most recognizable features of React. It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly inside JavaScript. While it may look like HTML, JSX is not HTML. It is a syntax extension that gets transformed into regular JavaScript before running in the browser.

Understanding JSX is essential because almost every React component returns JSX.

JSX stands for **JavaScript XML**. It allows you to describe the UI structure in a way that looks similar to HTML but works inside JavaScript files.

Example:
``` python
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, World</h1>;
}
```
Although this looks like HTML, it is actually JavaScript. Behind the scenes, JSX is converted into function calls.

For example, the above code is transformed (by tools like Babel) into:
``` python
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World");
```
This means JSX is simply a more readable way to write `React.createElement()` calls.
